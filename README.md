# physiopy-actions-workflows
A place to test github actions & workflows, and perhaps also automation related to the project board 

Added the label `automation` to the project board to capture some of these type of activities there - because they do not belong to one repo only!

## Workflows implemented in this test repo

*These can be implemented in other physiopy repos, if desired*
